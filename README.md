# navigation

We will create a simple app displaying the data of a companyâ€™s employees to show typical navigation patterns and routing features. The complete flow of the application can be seen in the figure below. We'll start with the home page which lets users do the following:

1. Display a Not Found page

2. Navigate to a list of employees and drill further down to see a Details page for each employee

3. Show an Employee Overview that they can search and sort
